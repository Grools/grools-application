GROOLS is a powerful reasoner representing knowledge as graph and dealing with uncertainties and contradictions for predictions and expectations. This application is a standalone tool that illustrates a possible usage of GROOLS API.

## Biological application
This GROOLS application is a bioinformatics software that helps biologists in the evaluation of genome functional annotation through biological processes like metabolic pathways.

Two different resources are used to represent biological knowledge:
 - [Genome Properties](http://www.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/genome-properties/index.cgi)
 - [UniPathway](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/D1/D761.long)

### Results
As a test case, the reasoner was launched on 14 prokaryotic genomes/proteomes using:
- UniPathway or Genome Properties as prior-knowledge to represent biological processes like  metabolic pathways
- and protein annotations from [MicroScope](https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope)  and [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org).

Results of this test case are available [here](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/grools/).

### Usage from shell script

Two shell scripts are available to grab annotations from MicroScope or UniProt using UniPathway or Genome Properties as prior-knowledge, respectively.

Shell scripts are easy to use. Once grools-application is build, you have to provide:
- the path to the jar file
- organism/proteome identifier
- expectation file in GROOLS CSV format

```bash
./scripts/uniprotTogrools.sh -g build/libs/grools-application-1.0.0.jar UP000000625 ~/expectation.csv
```
```bash
./scripts/microscopeTogrools.sh -g build/libs/grools-application-1.0.0.jar 36 ~/expectation.csv
```

### Usage from jar file
The application can be launched directly with the jar file, as follow:
```bash
java -jar  build/libs/grools-application-1.0.0.jar [-u/-g] observations.csv results_dir/
```

This application requires three parameters:
- file of observations (predictions and expectations) in GROOLS CSV format
- a directory to save results
- the option -g  or -u to choose between Genome Properties (-g) or UniPathway (-u) as a resource of prior-knowledge.

### GROOLS CSV file format
This file format allows user to declare observations that will be propagated on the prior-knowledge graph.
The header of the CSV file should be:
```csv
Name;EvidenceFor;Type;isPresent;Source;Label;Description
```
#### Fields
- **Name:** is a unique identifier
- **EvidenceFor:** is the name of the related prior-knowledge
- **Type:** CURATION,EXPERIMENTATION,COMPUTATION
- **isPresent:** T or F (True/False)
- **Source:** is the origin of the given observation (e.g. UniProt, MicroScope, BIOLOG)
- **Label:** is a short description of the observation 
- **Description:** is a complete description of the observation

#### Examples
- Files containing Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 observations for:
* UniProt (PFAM and TIGRFAM) and Biolog results related to Genome Properties ([link](https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/grools/UP000000430-AbaylyiADP1/genome-properties/uniprot/falsehood/UP000000430.csv))
* MicroScope (EC number, RHEA and MetaCyc reactions) and Biolog results related to UniPathway ([link](https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/grools/UP000000430-AbaylyiADP1/unipathway/microscope/specific/observations.csv))

## Build from source

Grools-application requires to pre-install some libraries:
- dot from [Graphviz](https://github.com/ellson/graphviz)
- [grools-reasoner](https://github.com/Grools/grools-reasoner)
- [bio-scribe](https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/bio-scribe)
- [grools-genome-properties](https://github.com/Grools/grools-genome-properties-plugins)
- [grools-obo](https://github.com/Grools/grools-obo-plugins)
- [grools-reporter](https://github.com/Grools/grools-reporter)

These projects use the powerful Gradle as build system. 
If you do not want or cannot install `gradle`, you may use the corresponding wrapper on each project:
- gradlew for unix
- gradlew.bat for windows

### Commands to build it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grools/grools-application
pushd grools-application
 bash build.sh
popd
```

The executable jar file will be located in `grools-application/build/libs/` directory
